    a. https://howchoo.com/g/ywi5m2vkodk/working-with-datetime-objects-and-timezones-in-python
    b. idk how the timezones currently work but we should probably make it so when you input your location it'll autocomplete this.
4. Tell the user the weather and temperature [DONE]
5. Tell the user what's on their calendar
6. Option to input how you're feeling that morning
7. Open their email automatically

HOW TO RUN:

So, theoretically, this ends up being a bash script(?) I think that means in the terminal you can run zao the same way you run something like "ls" and it greets you in your terminal window.

Dependencies:
1. requests
2. json
3. random
4. csv

Learning goals:
1. Installing modules + coding in python
2. Good code hygiene and organization
3. Manipulating data
